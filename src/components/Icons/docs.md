## Icons

The default Icon style is Material. For brands we rely on Ionic icons. There are a couple of custom icons, some which are Material, but are not yet part of react-icons, some which are custom creations but comply with Material stroke width and padding.


```react

<IconButton Icon={Icons.Share} label="Share"/>

```
