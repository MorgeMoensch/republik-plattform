# Republik Admin Frontend

## Usage

### Quick start

You need to have node 8.9+ installed.

Bootstrap your `.env` file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Install and run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The example env assumes a [Republik backend](https://github.com/orbiting/backends) running on port 5000. The backend needs to run on the same TLD for cookie sharing.
